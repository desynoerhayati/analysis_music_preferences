# "Comparative Analysis of Music Preferences in Springfield and Shelbyville Using Y.Music Data"

# Project Description
This project aims to examine and contrast the music preferences of listeners in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville utilizing data from Y.Music. In this study, we will evaluate several hypotheses regarding variations in music preferences depending on the day of the week, time of day, and the listener's city of residence.

# Objectives:
To test three hypotheses:
* User activity varies depending on the day and city.
* On Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday nights.
* Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. In Springfield, users prefer pop music, while in Shelbyville, rap music has more fans.

# Steps
Data related to user behavior is stored in the file /datasets/music_project_en.csv. There is no information regarding the quality of this data, so we need to examine it first before testing the hypotheses.

First, we will evaluate the data quality and determine if the issues are significant. Then, during data preprocessing, we will attempt to address the most serious issues.

This project consists of three stages:
* Data review
* Data preprocessing
* Hypothesis testing

# How to Run the Project
* Set Up Environment: Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed, such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

* Review Results: Check the output of the notebook to understand the music preferences of listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville.

# System Requirements
* Python 3.6 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook
